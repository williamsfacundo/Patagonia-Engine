1) Virtual Destructor: 

	- allows the user to extend from my engine class: 
	- When the destructor of the "derived" class is called, the destructor of the "base" class is called

2) Engine Application instance

	- We only want "ONE" posible engine application to be running

What happens if we want to extend the engine application into a user application?

	
	* The engine application is part of a dynamic library
	* Can we simply compile the library and use the engine application class in an extern application?
	* NO
	* WHY?
	* We have to export the "simbols" of this class an its methods so it is "visible" by the "extern" class
	* This symbols are exported to the "lib" file (static part of the library)
	* So then how we use the class?
	* We have to "link" the "lib" files into the external application
	* What we are going to use to do this: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/dllexport-dllimport?view=msvc-170 (dllexport, dllimport)

How can we stop the execution of the program if a condition is met?

	* We will create a directive call Assert
