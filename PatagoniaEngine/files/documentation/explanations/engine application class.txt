1) Virtual Destructor: 

	- allows the user to extend from my engine class: 
	- When the destructor of the "derived" class is called, the destructor of the "base" class is called

2) Engine Application instance

	- We only want "ONE" posible engine application to be running

3) What happens if we want to extend the engine application into a user application?

	a) 
		* The engine application is part of a dynamic library
		* Can we simply compile the library and use the engine application class in an extern application?
		* NO
		* WHY?
		* We have to export the "simbols" of this class an its methods so it is "visible" by the "extern" class
		* This symbols are exported to the "lib" file (static part of the library)
		* So then how we use the class?
		* We have to "link" the "lib" files into the external application
